## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

I propose you use a colleagues or family members or the polices phone services when google developers have used their admin privileges to sandbox your devices so that they can control everything you do and everyone you try to contact using android apks, the chromium project and various code snippets to get into your device then elevate their user setting. I would also audit developers constantly to see if they are abusing their rights. Right now I am being held digitally captive by a group of 7 developers who use their ain proveleges to keepe sandboxed so that I can never actually turn on or offy settings or contact the authorities unless it's in person.
